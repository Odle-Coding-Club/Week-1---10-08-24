Hello, i'm nathan.
i have been coding since i was 5, which makes 7 years.
my first language was scratch.
i started using python in 2020.
i made a bunch of video games in python/pygame (that were actually good).
i started competitive coding with C++ two years ago.
now, i grind leetcode every other day.
